## mix nerves.new

Now that we've got Nerves and friends installed on our machines we can look at creating our first nerves project. The bootstrap archive we just installed makes that nice and easy

```
# You can replace "blinky" with whatever you want
# to call your project.
$ mix nerves.new blinky
```

You'll be asked if you want to fetch and install dependencies. We do! Once that's done we can have a poke around in the project.

```
$ cd blinky
$ ls
```

Now that we've got this done, we can move on to [preparing your Linkit](prepare_linkit)
